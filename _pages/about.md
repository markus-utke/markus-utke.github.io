About me
======
I am currently a PhD candidate at Eindhoven University of Technology under the supervision of [Ulrike Schmidt-Kraepelin](https://sites.google.com/view/schmidt-kraepelin) and [Mark de Berg](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/mark-de-berg). I am interested in computational social choice topics such as truthfulness and fairness in different participatory budgeting settings.\
After finishing my Master's in computer science at TU Berlin in 2022 I did a three months research internship at Universidad de Chile under supervision of [José Correa](https://www.dii.uchile.cl/~jcorrea/) and worked for six months at the University of Amsterdam under [Ulle Endriss](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/u.endriss/).

**Pabuviz**\
[pabuviz.org](https://pabuviz.org/) is an interactive computation and visualization tool for participatory budgeting. It provides intuitive and visually appealing comparison tools based on real-life data. I developed it together with [Simon Rey](https://simonrey.fr/) while working at the University of Amsterdam in 2023.
